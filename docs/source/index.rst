Welcome to ReLeSO's documentation!
==================================
Reinforcement Learning based Shape Optimization (ReLeSO)
========================================================

**ReLeSO** stands for ``Reinforcement Learning based Shape Optimization`` and is a Python framework combining the spline base shape optimization approach with the reinforcement learning.

This documentation holds just the usage information and possible configuration parameters of this framework but not the theory behind this approach. Please see the thesis "Python Framework for Reinforcement Learning based Shape Optimization" by Clemens Fricke.  Please contact Clemens Fricke (clemens.david.fricke@tuwien.ac.at) or Daniel Wolff (wolff@cats.rwth-aachen.de) to access it.

This framework is mainly build upon the Python packages ``pydantic`` and ``stable-baselines3``.
