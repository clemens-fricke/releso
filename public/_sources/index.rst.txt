Spline based Shape Optimization via Reinforcement Learning (SbSOvRL)
====================================================================

**SbSOvRL** stands for ``Spline based Shape Optimization via Reinforcement Learning`` and is a Python framework combining the spline base shape optimization approach with the reinforcement learning.

This documentation holds just the usage information and possible configuration parameters of this framework but not the theory behind this approach. Please see the thesis "Python Framework for Reinforcement Learning based Shape Optimization" by Clemens Fricke.  Please contact Clemens Fricke (clemens.fricke@rwth-aachen.de) or Daniel Wolff (wolff@cats.rwth-aachen.de) to access it.

This framework is build with upon the Python packages ``pydantic``, ``stable-baselines3`` and ``OpenAI-gym``.
