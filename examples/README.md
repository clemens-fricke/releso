Examples
========

This folder contains a first example of the former converging channel test case,
however simulated with the open-source software `nutils`.

This folder is a placeholder for examples for this Framework. Due to size considerations the content of this folder was moved to a separate repository in the same group with the name ```Examples```


A few (outdated) example files are given, but there is no guarantee that the still work with the current package version.
