"""
Out of the box the SbSOvRL package uses agents implemented in the Python package
stable-baselines3. Currently the agents Deep Q-Network (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
can be used directly but the others can be added easily. 

The following table shows which agent can be used for which shape optimization approach:

+-------+---------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Agent | Direct shape optimization | Indirect shape optimization |
+=======+===========================+=============================+
| PPO   | YES                       | YES                         |
+-------+---------------------------+-----------------------------+
| DQN   | NO                        | YES                         |
+-------+---------------------------+-----------------------------+
| SAC   | YES                       | NO                          |
+-------+---------------------------+-----------------------------+
| DDPG  | YES                       | NO                          |
+-------+---------------------------+-----------------------------+
| A2C   | Yes                       | YES                         |
